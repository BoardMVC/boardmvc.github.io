        "text": "Well right, we didn't really show objects in our previous post. What \nhappened to the \"this\" keyword? What was this lousy area/2 message, where \none needed to provide the radius? Let's show how to bring about real \nobjects that have a reference to them selves. We will make use of the fix \npoint operator. Lets repeat the definition:\n\nfix(F, N) :- call(F, call(fix, F), N).\n\nThis means when sending a message to an object we cannot do it via call/2 \nanymore. But we have to use fix/2. And the object itself needs an \nadditional abstraction so that the fixpoint operator can do his work. Lets \nfirst check whether our attribute message still works:\n\n?- Obj=This^radius(X)^(X is 1.5), \nfix(Obj,radius(H)).\nH = 1.5\n\nOkay, we will use a modified area closure. Instead of the radius as a \nparameter, it will fetch the radius from This. Interestingly when \ninternally sending a message, we can still do it with call/2:\n\n?- Obj=This^(radius(X)^(X is 1.5); \narea(Y)^X^(call(This,radius(X)), Y is X*X*pi)), \nfix(Obj,area(J)).\nJ = 7.0685834705770345\n\nMultiple invokations of This should work in the same vain as our natural \nnumber check and factorial function were working with the fixpoint operator:\n\n?- Obj=This^(radius(X)^(X is 1.5); \narea(Y)^X^(call(This,radius(X)), Y is X*X*pi); \nshow^X^Y^(call(This,radius(X)), \nwrite('Radius: '), write(X), nl, call(This,area(Y)), \nwrite('Area: '), write(Y), nl)), \nfix(Obj,show).\nRadius: 1.5\nArea: 7.0685834705770345\n\nDifference to JavaScript so far: The Closure is immutable. But didn't check \nthe dynamic vs. static scoping issue yet.\n\nPrevious Post on Record Closures\nhttps://plus.google.com/u/0/b/103259555581227445618/103259555581227445618/posts/i7PK9s6QFfB\n﻿"

The variables that you define from outside a \nfunction can be used outside AND inside the function - these are \"global\". \nIt's because \"c\" is a local variable and we tried to make a global call of \n\"c\", which obviously makes no sense in JS. :)"

        "text": "Hi, what I don't understand about any tutorial video about source code, is \nhow any of this information, i.e. arrays, lists, whatever, is usable to a \nwebsite for a stranger visiting that site. None of these videos make any \nsense at all to me. It's like, ok, we have just written all this code and \nfor what? We have to have a server on our computer and we go to a blank \npage and refresh it and see one or two words that we could've just typed \nonto the page to begin with. Nobody ever explains how any of this code is \nuseful or how it all works together to make something happen on a webpage \nthat actually matters. Don't get me wrong, I understand you make easy to \nfollow videos, and they are better than most I've seen as far as \nexplaining, but nobody ever actually uses any of these codes in real world \nexplanations as far as how it is used in building a website and further \nmore, a particular type of website specifically. And that is really the \nmost important challenge for a beginner. If a person could first create a \ntutorial explaining the various source codes and their functions with real \nworld examples, i.e. popular websites who use these particular codes, how \nthey use them and why and even better still, how they tweak them for their \nown personal usefulness, well now, than we'd have ourselves a good tutorial \nvideo. After we know these things, as beginners, then we can determine \nwhich code sources we need and which tutorials to watch, we wouldn't waste \nenormous amounts of time on tutorials we don't even need, we'd also have a \ndirection in our studies, a road map, and we'd also understand to a much \nmore full respect what you are talking about on your tutorials and why it \nmatters. But it is almost impossible to concentrate and wade through \ncountless hours of inconsistent videos of people trying to explain what \nappears to be abstract information in generic ways we can't relate to or \nenvision. So if you really want to make a good starting point for every \nbeginner out there, than please work hard at making this video type I \nmentioned, and you'd be everybody's hero, you'd be original, you'd be the \nONLY one making these type's of videos and we'd all watch your other videos \nin a much more fuller understanding too. Otherwise you might as well call \nall of your videos advanced levels, not beginning, and also, they are \npretty much exactly the same as everyone else's videos too. You won't ever \nreally stand out from the crowd. I hope this message finds you well, \nsincerely, -a man trying hard as hell to learn.﻿"
