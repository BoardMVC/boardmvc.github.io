    "text": "To the few users who are reporting spam: thank you.  I appreciate it.  Sometimes it's not obvious because they're tech articles and I don't have time to check user profiles etc...\n\nTo those who haven't noticed much spam: that's probably because it's not \"traditional\" spam. They're not links to scam or porn sites - it's users abusing /r/javascript and using it as a promotional tool to get traffic to their (usually ad-ridden) blogs.\n\nI don't want to discourage users from posting their own content. The nature of programming is that you want to share your stuff.  You should clearly say in the title or comments that it's your own, and you should at least make some effort to participate in other threads in /r/javascript if you can.\n\nIf you want to post your own stuff, you should read the reddiquette and understand reddit's rules.  You should be an active participant in the reddit community, and you must still mostly post useful and interesting things that are not your own content.  We tend to be a little more lax than reddit's [self promotion guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion) (e.g. the suggested 90/10 rule), but that doesn't mean we're not keeping an eye on people who are just posting here for SEO / driving ad traffic.\n\nIf it's clear you just created the account so that you could promote your blog/posts on reddit, you may be banned from posting here. This isn't a free promotional tool for you to drive traffic or increase SEO, and spamming /r/javascript will not be tolerated.\n\nWe mods need your help, readers, in identifying spammers.  Thanks to those already helping out!",

Almost all use compositing, most use accelerated compositing. \n\nThe next (and probably final) step in rendering is getting primitives to draw with GL. When you use HTML and put text on the screen a font library kicks up, calculates all of the shapes sends it to a graphics library like Skia or Cairo and that is rendered to a bitmap, put into either GL as a texture (think of it being painted on glass) then the seperate peices of classes placed over each other (compositing).  \n\nGLSL/Vertex Shaders have the luxury of asking the hardware to do this. You completely skip compositing, painting, everything. You upload your shape, and a texture (color, gradient, image, whatever) then hit render and the GPU takes it from there.  This is essentially how 3D video games have worked for a very long time. Due to a range of issues from standards, patents and complexity its never really made it into webkit or any other browser i know of.\n\nI do (or at least I had heard) chromium was making a new \"backing layer\" to Skia called Ganeash, which does just this. But I about 8 months ago I couldn't find a single reference to any of it in their sources. ",

            "text": "Perhaps, my hopes is it will eventually be faster than native browsers.  Sounds nuts but there's two things C++ renders can't do, they don't optimize live with JIT's, which, as you can see with the demo as the JIT begins optimizing subsequent render calls fall exponentially. From 2.3~seconds for the first, to around 0.6~seconds on the third run (regardless if you change the HTML to an equivelant causing a full dump of the frame and recalc).  If you consider touch, animations, layout these may initially run slower in a JS version than a browser but would get very close to their native speed. \n\nDue to the \"lambda\"-ness of javascript, code can be cut and refactored even by itself (using a safe heap in emscripten). This allows for on the fly \"self-optimizations\" using parallel processing technologies like webcl/opencl (glsl currently) to improve performance - parts of the program can be broken off from itself and calculated in parallel with a GPU. WebKit is didn't long ago finish threading its compositor and HTML parser, there's tons of things from the CSS JITTER and Z-order processing that can be done in parallel. What's incredibly unmanagable to do in C++ static code (let alone at a C++ runtime) you can quickly prototype up in javascript.\n\nEven if this results in a minor performance improvement of 7~10% you're now faster than a native C++ build (abliet, sans jitting someone could go rewrite all that webkit code and pull in threads and opencl, but trust me, its a LOT of work). \n\nBut then consider with GLSL drawing primitives you can leave behind older libraries such as skia, cairo, pixman that draw/paint everything in software. I believe chrome is racing to this end with Ganesh in skia.  But progress is slow, and hard to move forward, seeing how fast the javascript community works, completely porting all GraphicsContext commands into complete shader programs isn't improbable.\n\nFinally, you can also use linear algebra in vertex calculations and system of equations to calculate layout at nearly 48x the normal speed of a traditional render, these are big significant increases in speed that WebKit for a large part hasn't touched because layout is a hallow ground.\n\nIt seems lofty, i know. I don't really believe it myself, but being knee deep in it for the last year and a half, i'm beginning to see the line between point A and B, and its not as far as I thought.\n\n",

I would much rather just bind events to node properties directly so that they can be garbage collected the moment the reference to the DOM node is destroyed or when clobbered by another handler being assigned to that same event.",
